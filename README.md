## **Phase 3: Team Practice and Mock CTFs (Weeks 13-16)**  
**Goal**: Apply skills in a team setting and simulate real CTF environments.

### **Week 13-14: Team Collaboration**
- **Activities**:
  - Divide the team into specialized roles (Web, Reversing, Forensics, Crypto, Misc).
  - Solve challenges together, focusing on teamwork and communication.

### **Week 15-16: Mock CTF**
- **Activities**:
  - Organize a 24-hour mock CTF with challenges from past CTFs or self-created challenges.
  - Simulate real CTF conditions (time limits, team collaboration).
  - Review performance and identify areas for improvement.

---

## **Phase 4: Real CTF Participation (Ongoing)**  
**Goal**: Gain experience by participating in real CTFs.

### **Activities**:
- **Start Small**: Participate in beginner-friendly CTFs on [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org) or [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org).
- **Graduate to Advanced CTFs**: Move on to more challenging CTFs as your team improves.
- **Post-CTF Review**:
  - Analyze challenges you couldnâ€™t solve.
  - Read write-ups and learn new techniques.
